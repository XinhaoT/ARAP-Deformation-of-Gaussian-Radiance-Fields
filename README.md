# ARAP-Deformation-of-Gaussian-Radiance-Fields

## Description

This is an implementation of the paper *ARAP-Deformation-of-Gaussian-Radiance-Fields*. It includes an interactive system that allows users to perform ARAP deformation on Gaussian Radiance Fields interactively.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XinhaoT/ARAP-Deformation-of-Gaussian-Radiance-Fields.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ARAP-Deformation-of-Gaussian-Radiance-Fields
   ```
3. Build the project using CMake:
   ```bash
   # Dependencies
   sudo apt install -y libglew-dev libassimp-dev libboost-all-dev libgtk-3-dev libopencv-dev libglfw3-dev libavdevice-dev libavcodec-dev libeigen3-dev libxxf86vm-dev libembree-dev
   # build
   cmake -Bbuild . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build build -j24 --target install
   ```
4. **Note:** Modify `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` in the CMake file according to your GPU architecture. The current setting is `75`, tested on an **RTX 2080 Super**. We have tested on an **RTX 4090** withÂ `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89` as well.
5. **Attention:** During the build process, the required libraries will be downloaded automatically and stored in the `extlibs` folder. Before running the project, please ensure that all dependencies have been successfully downloaded.

## Quick Start

Run the following command to start the interactive application:

```bash
./install/bin/SIBR_gaussianViewer_app -m datasets/stripes/
```

### Optional

You can specify the number of OpenMP threads by setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. For example:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=16 ./install/bin/SIBR_gaussianViewer_app -m datasets/stripes/
```


## Data Format and Preparation

#### Stage II Align 3DGS with Radiance Field

### Saving and Reproducing the Deformation Process


## TODO

Currently, this project supports ARAP deformation of radiance fields under the flat-Gaussian representation proposed in the paper *GaMeS: Mesh-Based Adapting and Modification of Gaussian Splatting*. We will provide detailed usage instructions as soon as possible.
